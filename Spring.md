<blockquote> 
    
- Core business component defined insider Spring applications is termed as `Bean`. 
- In simple terms `Bean` is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by a Spring IoC container.
- Each technology has branded their core business components by certain nomenclature. For example, Business component in `JavaEE` applications are termed as `Servlet`, in `Web Services` they are named as `Resource` in `Struts` framework they are called `ActionForm` etc.

2. How do you decide whether to create `Singleton` bean or `Prototype` bean in application?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Though Spring IOC container has excellent support to manage the lifecycle of different types of beans,
Spring does not manage the complete lifecycle of a prototype bean.
- The IOC container instantiates, configures, decorates, and otherwise assembles a prototype object, hands it to the client and then has no further knowledge of that `Prototype` instance.
- For most of the simple to average applications `Singleton` bean are sufficient and serve the purpose at each layer e.g. DAO, Service, Controller etc.
- Developer need to take smart decisions & identify which beans must be singleton, else multiple client requests using singleton bean can modify the state of common objects wrongly.
- Some dependent objects need a bean that has private state so that they can conduct their processing separately from other objects that depend on the bean. In this case, singletons are clearly not suitable, and we consider prototypes.
- If you have a bean that has a lot of writable state, you may find that the cost of synchronization is greater than the cost of creating a new instance to handle each request from a dependent object that time you can use prototype bean.

3. When do you use `Session` and `Request` bean in Spring?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- Both beans are used mainly in Web Application.
- If the bean scope is `Request`, then on every request (from same user or different user) a new bean will be created.
- If the bean scope is `Session` then on every request same bean would be returned if requests are within the same user session also made from a client which is capable of maintaining the session (`curl` command can't maintain the user session unless pass cookie/session identifier header).
- `Session` beans are not destroyed until session timeout up or session destroyed.

4. How an IOC container is configured in a spring console based application?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- Spring IOC container is primarily responsible for holding all business components termed as `Bean`.
- Few of these beans are added by spring framework and rest all are defined by developers.
- These beans can be configured using XML configuration file (usually named as `applicationContext.xml`) or using Java Configuration class (usually named as `AppConfig.java`).
- **`applicationContext.xml` sample** -
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
     http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-4.3.xsd">

    <bean id="intelProcessor" class="com.revature.model.Intel">
        <property name="modelName" value ="Intel i7"/>
        <property name="cacheMemory" value="64MB" />
        <property name="price" value="6700.00"/>
        <property name="numberOfCores" value="7 Cores" />
    </bean>
    <bean id="myLaptop" class="com.revature.model.Laptop" autowire="no">
        <property name="modelName" value="Lenovo Think PagEdge" />
        <property name="price" value="78900.00" />
        <property name="processor" ref="intelProcessor" />
    </bean>
    <bean id="yourLaptop" class="com.revature.model.Laptop" autowire="no">
        <constructor-arg value="Alienware"></constructor-arg>
        <constructor-arg value="98900.00"></constructor-arg>
        <constructor-arg ref="intelProcessor" ></constructor-arg>
    </bean>
</beans>
```
- **`AppConfig.java` sample** -

```java
package com.revature.config;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Description;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope;
//Assume below model classes exist in the application
import com.revature.model.Intel;
import com.revature.model.Laptop;

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean(name = "i7")
    @Description("This bean is used to injection dependency inside Laptop class")
    public Intel getIntelProcessor() {
        return new Intel("Intel i7", "64MB", 6700.0, "7 Cores");
    }

    @Bean
    @Description("My Lenovo Laptop Bean")
    public Laptop myLaptop() {
        // This is JavaConfig Alternative for Setter Based Injection
        Laptop myLappy = new Laptop();
        myLappy.setModelName("Lenovo Think PagEdge");
        
        // In applciationContext.xml this value will be in double quotes unlike
        // java developers who want it without double quotes
        myLappy.setPrice(78900.00);
        myLappy.setProcessor(getIntelProcessor());
        return myLappy;
    }

    @Bean
    @Description("Your Mac Book Pro Laptop Bean")
    @Scope("singleton")
    public Laptop yourLaptop() {
        // This is JavConfig Alternative for Constructor Based Injection
        Laptop yourLappy = new Laptop("Mac Book Pro",149000.0, getIntelProcessor());
        return yourLappy;
    }

    /* --- Comparison ---
        @Configuration  //== applicationContext.xml
        class AppConfig
        @Bean   //== <bean>
        public Amd amd(){  // id=amd class="com.revature.model.Amd"
        Amd a= new Amd();
        a.setPrice();     // <property name="price" value="23232"/>
        ....
        ....
        return a;
        }
    */
}
```
- The Spring IOC container can be programmatically accessed using two interfaces namely: `BeanFactory` & `ApplicationContext`.
- It's always advisable to use ApplicationContext which is child interface of BeanFactory.
- There are multiple implementations available of ApplicationContext depending upon your bean configuration.
- For `applicationContext.xml` based bean configuration we use `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` class.
```java
package com.revature.client;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;
import com.revature.model.Laptop;
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Laptop lenovoLaptop, secondLaptop;
        ApplicationContext appContext = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");
        lenovoLaptop = (Laptop) appContext.getBean("myLaptop");
        System.out.println(lenovoLaptop);
        secondLaptop = (Laptop) appContext.getBean("yourLaptop");
        System.out.println(secondLaptop);
        ((ClassPathXmlApplicationContext) appContext).close();
    }
}
```
- For `AppConfig.java` based bean configuration we use `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` class.

```java
package com.revature.client;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext;
import com.revature.config.AppConfig;
//Assume below model classes exist in the application
import com.revature.model.Laptop;
import com.revature.model.Processor;
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AnnotationConfigApplicationContext  appContext = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
        Laptop lenovoLaptop, secondLaptop;
        Processor intelProcessor;

        System.out.println("/////////////////////////////////");
        intelProcessor= (Processor) appContext.getBean("i7");
        System.out.println(intelProcessor);
        
        System.out.println("/////////////////////////////////");
        lenovoLaptop = (Laptop) appContext.getBean("myLaptop");
        System.out.println(lenovoLaptop);
        
        System.out.println("/////////////////////////////////");
        secondLaptop = (Laptop) appContext.getBean("yourLaptop");
        System.out.println(secondLaptop);
            
        appContext.close();
        
    }
}

5. How to decide upon choosing BeanFactory or ApplicationContext in Spring application?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 

- The Spring IOC container can be programmatically accessed using two interfaces namely: `BeanFactory` & `ApplicationContext`
- The BeanFactory is the root interface and the ApplicationContext extends the features of BeanFactory.
- BeanFactory loads beans on-demand (`Lazy Loading`), while ApplicationContext loads all beans at startup(`Eager Loading`). 
- BeanFactory is lightweight as compared to ApplicationContext.
- BeanFactory only supports two scopes â€” Singleton and Prototype, but ApplicationContext supports all types of bean scopes. 
- ApplicationContext enhances BeanFactory to provide several features that are suitable for enterprise applications.
- ApplicationContext provides messaging (`i18n` or internationalization) functionality, event publication functionality, annotation-based dependency injection, and easy integration with Spring AOP features.
- It's always advisable to use ApplicationContext.
- We should use BeanFactory only when memory consumption is critical.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
    
<blockquote> 

- There are broadly two ways in which Spring beans are configured in application-
    - Using XML configuration â€“ We usually define xml file with standard name as `applicationContext.xml` inside `src/main/resources` folder of your maven project.
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-4.3.xsd">
        <bean id="intelProcessor" class="com.revature.model.Intel">
            <property name="modelName" value ="Intel i7"/>
            <property name="cacheMemory" value="64MB" />
            <property name="price" value="6700.00"/>
            <property name="numberOfCores" value="7 Cores" />
        </bean>
    </beans>
    ```
    - Using Annotation configuration - `@Bean`, `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`, `@RestController`
    ```java
    @Component("employeeDtoForReport")  // Bean id - employeeDtoForReport
    public class EmployeeDto{
    //.....
    }

    @RestController // Bean id - employeeRestController 
    public class EmployeeRestController {
    //.....
    }

    @Repository   //Bean id - DepartmentRepository 
    public interface DepartmentRepository extends JpaRepository<Department, Long> {
    //.....
    }

    @Service //Bean id - employeeServiceImpl
    public class EmployeeServiceImpl implements EmployeeService {
    //.....
    }

    @Controller
    public class PayrollController {
    //.....
    }
    
    @Configuration
    public class AppConfig {
        @Bean 
        public void beanName(){   
            //.....

7. How Spring supports connection pooling? Elaborate what is connection pooling?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>
    
<blockquote> 

- Database connections are expensive operation.
- A connection pool is like a collection of open connections. 
- If a connection is established or created it should be added to the connection pool.
- When a connection is released, it's returned back to the pool, so other clients can reuse it.
- While the connection is open it can be used again and again.
- Spring support connection pooling by supporting configuration of DataSource inside application.
- Spring provides `DriverManagerDataSource` for testing application during development phase.
- There are third party DB connection pooling providers like `Apache DBCP`, `Hikari CP` etc. which can also be configured in application.
- `DriverManagerDataSource` sample -

8. What is usual cause of `org.springframework.beans.factory.NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException`?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Exception thrown when a BeanFactory is asked for a bean instance for which multiple matching candidates have been found when only one matching bean was expected.
- To understand problem, consider below situation where we have three input interfaced namely `Keyboard`, `Mouse` and `Joystick` implementing `Usb` interface.
- The class `Counterstrike` has one dependency called `gameControl` of type `Usb`.
- The Spring container while injecting dependency gameControl has confusion, as there are three qualifying beans for desired match, hence we will get `NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException` exception.

    ```java
    @Component
    public class Keyboard implements Usb{
        //....
    }
    @Component
    public class Mouse implements Usb{
        //....
    }
    @Component
    public class Joystick implements Usb{
        //....
    }

    @Component
    public class Counterstrike {
        @Autowired
        private Usb gameControl;
        //....
    }
    ```
- The solution for the exception will be using `@Qualifier` annotation with exact matching bean name-
    ```java
    @Component
    public class Counterstrike {
        @Autowired
        @Qualifier("joystick")
        private Usb gameControl;

9. Have you configured Init & Destroy spring bean lifecycle hooks? 

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Spring provides several ways through which you can tap into the bean lifecycle. 
- For example, once a bean is instantiated, you might need to perform some initialization to get the bean into a usable state. 
- Similarly, you might need to clean up resources before a bean is removed from the container.
- These actions can be achieved by configuring Init and Destroy lifecycle hooks into Spring application.
- `@PostConstruct` Annotation:
    - Whenever we annotate a method in Spring Bean with `@PostConstruct` annotation, it gets executed after the spring bean is initialized. 
    - We can have only one method annotated with `@PostConstruct` annotation. 
- `@PreDestroy` Annotation: 
    - When we annotate a Spring Bean method with PreDestroy annotation, it gets called when the bean instance is getting removed from the context.
    - Note: if your spring bean scope is `Prototype` then itâ€™s not completely managed by the spring container and the PreDestroy method wonâ€™t get called. 
- Both of the above annotation are part of Common Annotations API and itâ€™s part of JDK module `javax.annotation-api`. 
- Letâ€™s look at simple example below:
- `MailService.java` file-
```java
package com.revature;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
@Scope(scopeName = ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON)
public class MailService {
   private Map<String, String> map=null;
   public MailService() {
      map=new HashMap<>();
   }
   public void send(String mailTo){
      //Send mail code
      System.out.println("Inside send email method - "+mailTo);
   }
   @PostConstruct
   public void init() {
      map.put("host", "mail.gd.com");
      map.put("port", "25");
      map.put("from", "example@gd.com");
      System.out.println("Inside init method - "+map);
   }
   @PreDestroy
   public void destroy() {
      map.clear();
      System.out.println("Inside destroy method - "+map);
   }
}
```
- `MainApp.java` file-

```java
package com.revature.app;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext;
import com.revature.MailService;

public class MainApp {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      AnnotationConfigApplicationContext context = 
            new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
      // Send mail 1
      MailService mailService1 = (MailService) context.getBean("mailService");
      mailService1.send("coupancodes@gd.com");
      // Send mail 2
      MailService mailService2 = context.getBean(MailService.class);
      mailService2.send("newletters@gd.com");
      context.close();
   }
}

10. How do you decide as developer to choose among `.properties` or `.yaml` configuration file in Spring Boot application? 

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- In Spring Boot, we use an external configuration to define our properties.
- This allows us to use the same application code in different environments.
- We can use properties files, YAML files, environment variables and command-line arguments.
- `application.properties` file, which uses a key-value format:
    - Here each line is a single configuration, so we need to express hierarchical data by using the same prefixes for our keys. 
```
management.endpoint.health.group.custom.include=*
management.endpoint.health.group.custom.show-components=always
management.endpoint.health.group.custom.show-details=always
```
- `application.yml` file, which uses a key-value format:
    - YAML is a convenient format for specifying hierarchical configuration data. 
    - The below code is more readable than .properties file alternative, due to lack of repeated prefixes.
```yml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      base-path: /
  endpoint:
    health:
      show-details: ALWAYS
      probes:
        enabled: true
      group:
        readiness:
          include: db, diskSpace

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Yes, Dependency Injection is a concept rather and then a framework. 
- When the application under question is small, we can always meet the needs by injecting dependencies manually, without using any framework like Spring.
- We can use Factory Design Pattern and create dependencies which will then be passed to required classes.
- Though such code cannot replace the DI framework like Spring which provide much more extensive set of features.

- Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) are not mutually exclusive.
- AOP can be good addition to OOP.
- OOP is mainly used to model business logic whereas AOP helps to organize non-functional aspects (called cross cutting concerns) like Auditing, Logging, Transaction Management, Security etc.
- AOP helps to build methods without clogging up the business code with the cross-cutting concerns.

2. Why we need to use AspectJ in Spring application?

![Easy](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/simple%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Spring provides simple and powerful ways of writing custom aspects (a modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes) by using @AspectJ annotation style. 
- @AspectJ refers to a style of declaring aspects as regular Java classes annotated with annotations. 
- The @AspectJ style was introduced by the AspectJ project as part of the AspectJ 5 release. 
- Spring interprets the same annotations as AspectJ 5, using a library supplied by AspectJ for pointcut parsing and matching. 
- Spring seamlessly integrates Spring AOP and IoC with AspectJ, to enable all uses of AOP within a consistent Spring-based application architecture.
- The @AspectJ support can be enabled with XML- or Java-style configuration. 
- In either case, we also need to ensure that AspectJâ€™s `aspectjweaver.jar` library is on the class path of application (version 1.8 or later). 
- This library is available in the lib directory of an AspectJ distribution or from the Maven Central repository.
- `pom.xml` sample-
```xml
    <properties>
        <aspectJ.version>1.6.11</aspectJ.version>
    </properties>
    <dependencies>
        <!-- AspectJ -->

- There is no restriction from compiler, and we can call the Repository layer from the Controller layer directly.
- The layering helps to segregate the Spring application responsibilities and enables loose coupling between the objects.
- Service layer in the application facilitates communication between the Controller and the Persistence/Repository/DAO layer.
- Service layer usually holds business logic e.g. It may include validation logic.
- One Service layer may depend on multiple Repository layers to serve a specific business purpose.
- The method names in Service layer are usually named as per the business purpose they serve whereas method names in Repository are named as standard CRUD operations supported by that Repository.
- Hence, we need Service layer between DAO and Controller layer.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- One of the routine tasks for a developer is to check the status of the already launched production application periodically.
- To simplify this task, Spring Boot provides a sub-project named Spring Boot Actuator.
- Spring Actuator exposes operational information about the executing application, including, metrics, info, dump, env, etc. 
- The information is accessed usually via HTTP endpoints, a few of which are listed below:
    - `/health` summarizes the health status of our application.
    - `/beans` returns all available beans in our BeanFactory.
    - `/envy returns the current environment properties. 
- To enable Spring Boot Actuator, we just need to add the spring-boot-actuator dependency to our maven package manager.

```XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
- To access the actuator endpoints using HTTP, we need to both enable and expose them.
- Only the /health and /info endpoints are exposed by default.
- We need to add the following configuration to expose all endpoints: 
`management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*`

```java
@Configuration
@Profile("prod")
public class ProductionConfiguration {
 // ...
}

@Configuration
@Profile("test")
public class TestConfiguration {
 // ...
}
```
- In the normal Spring way, you can use a `spring.profiles.active` environment property to specify which profiles are active. 
- You can specify the property in any of the usual ways, for example, you could include it in your application.properties:
`spring.profiles.active=test`
or specify on the command line using the switch `--spring.profiles.active=prod`.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- The application development process undergoes different stages; the typical ones are development, testing, and production. 
- Spring Boot profiles help group parts of the application configuration and make it available only in certain environments.
- A profile is a set of configuration settings. 
- Spring Boot allows to definition profile of -specific property files in the form of `application-{profile}.properties`.
- We can define both profile-specific and default application.properties file in the application. (For example, if your application activates a profile named prod and uses YAML files, then both application.yml and application-prod.yml will be considered).
- The local/default profile (`application.properties`) is usually called `default`; all the beans that do not have a profile set belong to the `default` profile.
- Spring automatically loads the properties in an application.properties file for all profiles and the ones in profile-specific property files only for the specified profile. 
- The keys in the profile-specific property override the ones in the default property file.
- There are plenty of ways of defining active profiles in Spring Boot, including command line arguments, Maven settings, JVM system parameters, environment variables, spring.profiles.active property, and SpringApplication methods.
- We commonly set active profiles using the `spring the .profiles.active` property or command line argument.
- For Example, we have three profiles (`local/default`, `dev`, `prod`) and two profile-specific property files as below:
```
pom.xml
src
â”œâ”€â”€ main
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ java

<blockquote> 
    
- To restrict the input provided by the user in Spring MVC applications, the Spring >=4 supports and uses `Bean Validation API`.
- The Bean Validation API is a Java specification which is used to apply constraints to the fields of a class via annotations. 
- Using Bean Validation API we can validate a length, number, regular expression, etc. as well, and build custom validations.
- `Hibernate Validator` is the most famous/used implementation of the Bean Validation API specification.
- There are 3 types of variables that can be validated using Bean Validation API:
  - The request body,
  - Variables within the path (e.g., id in /api/{id}) and,
  - Query parameters.
- Spring Boot comes with the validation starter, which needs to be included in `pom.xml` file and the intern added the `hibernate-validator` dependency as below:

<blockquote> 
    
- The `@ExceptionHandler` is an annotation used to handle a specific exception in the controller and send a custom response to the client.
- We need to have a method annotated with @ExceptionHandler which takes Exception Class (any exception that you want to handle) as an argument, if any of these exceptions are raised in the controller, then this handler method will handle it.
- If we have two handler methods in the same controller say for example one handler for Exception and another handler for RuntimeException, then the handler method which is closer to the Exception Class hierarchy is triggered. 
- For example, if NullPointerException is thrown then IOException handler method is triggered, which is the closest to the Exception class.
```java
@ControllerAdvice(basePackages = "{com.revature.controller}")
public class RestApiExceptionHandlerAdvice {
    @ExceptionHandler(value = BadRequestException.class)
    public ErrorMessage handleBadRequest(BadRequestException exception) {
        //code...

- HAL is a simple format that gives a consistent and easy way to hyperlink between resources in your API.
- Adopting HAL make API explorable, and its documentation easily discoverable from within the API itself. 
- In short, it makes API easier to work with and therefore more attractive to client developers.
- The HAL browser provides an in-browser GUI to traverse your Spring RESTful API.
- Below is the single dependency needed to integrate the HAL browser into our REST API. 

```xml
  <dependency>
	  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
	  <artifactId>spring-data-rest-hal-explorer</artifactId>
  </dependency>
```
- If we have the above dependency, Spring will auto-configure the HAL browser, and make it available via the default endpoint.
- All we need to do now is press run and switch to the browser. The HAL browser will then be available on http://localhost:8080/

![Complex](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Complex%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- `CrudRepository` has only `save` but it acts as an `update` as well.
- When we `save` an entity with an empty `id` it will do a save.
- When you do `save` on the entity wan its existing `id` it will do an `update`.
- This means after we used findById and changed something in returned object, we can call save on that object and it will do an update because after findById you get an object with a populated id that exists in our database.
- `save` in `CrudRepository` can accept a single entity or Iterable of our entity type.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Calling the `save` method to update an object inside a transactional method is not mandatory.
- When we use the `findById` method to retrieve an entity within a transactional method, the returned entity is managed by the persistence provider. 
- Hence, any change to that entity will be automatically persisted in the database, regardless of whether we are invoking the save method inside a transactional method.

- `Spring Data` provides multiple ways to define a query that we can execute.
- One of these popular methods is using `@Query` annotation.
- We can annotate the `Spring Data` repository method with the `@Query` annotation where its `value` attribute contains the `JPQL` or `SQL` to be executed.
- It's a convenient approach to place a query definition just above the method inside the repository rather than inside our domain model as named queries.

9. Explain the query builder mechanism in the Spring Data repository?

![Medium](https://github.com/revaturelabs/interviewquestions/blob/dev/ComplexityTags/Medium%20(2).svg)

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- The query builder mechanism built into the `Spring Data` repository infrastructure is useful for building constraining queries over entities of the repository.
- The query method names are divided into `subject` and `predicate`.
- The first part (`findâ€¦By`, `existsâ€¦By`) defines the subject of the query, and the second part forms the predicate.
- Few Queries subject keywords - `findâ€¦By`, `getâ€¦By`, `countâ€¦By`, `â€¦Distinctâ€¦`, `deleteâ€¦By`,`Top<number>â€¦`
- Few Queries predicate keywords - `Containing`, `After`, `Before`, `Between`, `EndingWith`, `StartsWith`, `LessThan`, `GreaterThan`
- Few Query predicate modifier keywords - `IgnoreCase`, `OrderByâ€¦`
- Example-
```java
interface PersonRepository extends Repository<Person, Long> {

  List<Person> findByEmailAddressAndLastname(EmailAddress emailAddress, String lastname);

  // Enables the distinct flag for the query
  List<Person> findDistinctPeopleByLastnameOrFirstname(String lastname, String firstname);
  List<Person> findPeopleDistinctByLastnameOrFirstname(String lastname, String firstname);

  // Enabling ignoring the case for an individual property
  List<Person> findByLastnameIgnoreCase(String lastname);
 
  // Enabling ignoring the case for all suitable properties
  List<Person> findByLastnameAndFirstnameAllIgnoreCase(String lastname, String firstname);

  // Enabling static ORDER BY for a query
  List<Person> findByLastnameOrderByFirstnameAsc(String lastname);
  List<Person> findByLastnameOrderByFirstnameDesc(String lastname);

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Whenever a request comes it first goes to the DispatcherServlet where it then tries to identify its handler method (the methods defined in the specific controller to handle the requests) using Handler mapping.
- Once the handler mapping returns the controller the DispatcherServlet knows the controller which can handle the request and goes there for further request processing.
- Once the controller returns the view the DispatcherServlet goes to the view resolver to identify where the view is located.
- DispatcherServlet then grabs the view and returns as the final l response.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- Since DispatcherServlet is one type of Servlet the web.xml file configuration is the same as normal servlet.
- Additionally, as DispatcherServlet is our front controller we need to ensure that all the incoming requests should be routed to it using "/" url pattern.
```xml
<servlet>
    <servlet-name>dispatcher</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>
        org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet
    </servlet-class>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>dispatcher</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```
- If we are using `the spring-boot-starter-web` starter, DispatcherServletauto-configured to the URL pattern "/". So, we don't need to do any additional configuration in the web.xml file.

- It's very simple, we need to change two properties inside the application.properties file.
```
server.servlet.context-path=/admin
spring.mvc.servlet.path=/v2
```
- With the above customizations, DispatcherServlet is configured to handle the URL pattern /v2 and the rcontext Path will be /admin. 
- Thus, DispatcherServlet listens at http://localhost:8080/admin/v2/.

<blockquote> 
    
- MIME stands for Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions. 
- MIME types form a standard way of classifying file types on the Internet. 
- Internet programs such as Web servers and browsers all have a list of MIME types so that they can transfer files of the same type in the same way, no matter what operating system they are working in.
- A MIME type has two parts: a `type` and a `subtype`. They are separated by a slash (`/`) i.e., `type/subtype`. 
- For example, the MIME type for Microsoft Word files is an application and the subtype is ms-word. Together, the complete MIME type is application/ms-word.
- The entire list of MIME types is available under Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) website- https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml

    - There is no restriction on what a resource can be. 
    - Any information that can be named can be a resource: a document or image, a temporal service (e.g., "today's weather in Los Angeles"), a collection of other resources, a non-virtual object (e.g., a person), and so on.
  - What is a `representation`-
    - A JSON document can be used to represent the state of a particular resource. A resource can have many representations, such as JSON and/or XML documents, and the client can use content negotiation to request different representations of the same resource.
  - What is a `state transfer`-
    - The state of a given resource can be retrieved and manipulated using representations.

<details> <summary> <b> Show Answer </b> </summary>

<blockquote> 
    
- APIs only need to be up-versioned when a breaking change is made. Breaking changes include:
  - Change in the format of the response data for one or more calls
  - Change in the request or response type (i.e., changing an integer to a float)
  - Removing any part of the API.
- There are multiple ways to version RESTful API-
  - One controller class with multiple methods having separate versions for mapping URLs.
  - One controller class with one method having separate versions number passed as path variables.
  - One controller class with one method having separate versions number passed as a custom request header.
  - Multiple controller classes marked with version names with their method names. 
- Breaking changes should always result in a change to the major version number for an API or content response type.
- Non-breaking changes, such as adding new endpoints or new response parameters, do not require a change to the major version number.
- Example of using two controller classes serving different versions-
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1")
public class ControllerV1 {
  //...
}

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v2")
public class ControllerV2 {

- In one web application, there can be multiple WebApplicationContext. 
- In one web application, there can be multiple DispatcherServlet, one for handling request and returns view whereas another which handle REST request & responses. 
- Each DispatcherServlet is associated with a single WebApplicationContext. 
- The WebApplicationContext configuration file `*-servlet.xml` is specific to the DispatcherServlet and a web application can have more than one DispatcherServlet configured to handle the requests and each DispatcherServlet would have a separate `*-servlet.xml` file to configure.

- `*-servlet.xml` defines the beans that are related only to specific DispatcherServlet. 
- All our Spring MVC controllers are defined in this file.
- There is nothing wrong in defining all the beans in the `*-servlet.xml` if we are running only one DispatcherServlet in our web application.
